      <p>We have obtained your data from your application for CITES permits to move or trade endangered species. This data is provided either from you directly or someone authorised to act on your behalf.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why Defra and APHA are using your data</h2>
      <p>When you apply for CITES permits to move or trade endangered species, we will use your data to check that you comply with and to enforce the agreement.</p>
      <p>This means that we will keep official records of your compliance history as evidence. For purposes of enforcing CITES, we may share your data with other parties including JNCC, Kew and Border Force.</p>
      <p>We will share your data when we review your application, so that an expert from our scientific authorities can assess the application.</p>
      <p>We may also:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>contact you or someone acting on your behalf to request further information on the application</li>
        <li>contact you to tell you an application has been made on your behalf</li>
        <li>contact you if we suspect that your specimen does not comply with CITES</li>
        <li>check that you or someone acting on your behalf complies with CITES</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The legal basis for processing your data</h2>
      <p>Where APHA uses your data to help develop an assessor’s expertise, the legal basis for this data-use is described in Article 6 (1) (a) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Article 6 (1) (a) relates to processing your data where you have freely and voluntarily given consent for your data to be used for that purpose.</p>
      <p>Where APHA uses your data to check that the specimen complies with CITES, the legal basis for this data use is described in Article 6 (1) (e) of the UK GDPR.

      <p>Defra and APHA are official authorities and make up a UK government department that has official responsibility for regulating the implementation and application of CITES.</p>
      <p>Consent to process your data to help further the expertise of the prescribed institution. You can withdraw your consent at any time before your data is shared with an expert assessor to help them to further their expertise.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">A law-based requirement to provide personal data</h2>
      <p>You are required by law to provide your data to APHA so they can ensure that any movement or trade of endangered species is compliant with CITES. There is a statutory requirement for you to provide your personal data.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens if you do not provide the necessary data</h2>
      <p>Without necessary data, we will not be able to process your application for a permit. You will not be able to move or trade the specimen within your application.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who Defra and APHA share your data with</h2>
      <p>We will share your data with the assessor who assesses the application to give their expert opinion on whether the item meets the exemption criteria.</p>
      <p>Your personal data is shared with assessors to review your application, as well as third parties including JNCC, Kew and Border Force.</p>
      <p>We will not share your data with any other third parties, except where we are required to do so by law or court order, to detect or prevent crime, or to apprehend or prosecute offenders.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Storing data outside the UK</h2>
      <p>Personal data may be stored or hosted in Ireland.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long Defra and APHA hold personal data</h2>
      <p>Under CITES, there is a statutory requirement for us to hold data on CITES where an applicant has applied for a permit. This application would have been under the provisions governing exemptions in the agreement.</p>
      <p>Personal data will be held for seven years from the date we receive your application. It will be reviewed to determine whether a further retention period is required to ensure compliance with and appropriate enforcement of CITES. Data will be manually deleted once it has been determined it is appropriate to do so.</p>
